Okay, here are instructions for an AI model on how to format the dumped file contents so that the Python script can parse it correctly.

Instructions for Dumping File Contents

When providing the complete contents of all project files, please adhere strictly to the following format for each file:

Start Marker: Begin each file's content with a start marker on its own line:

--- START OF FILE path/to/your/file.ext ---


Replace path/to/your/file.ext with the actual, full path of the file relative to the project root (e.g., README.md, extension/popup.js, src/utils/helpers.py).

Do not include backticks (`) around the filename in the START marker.

Opening Code Fence: Immediately following the START marker line, place an opening Markdown code fence including the appropriate language identifier:

```language
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Examples: ```python, ```javascript, ```html, ```css, ```json, ```markdown, ```text

Optional Content Filename Marker: If applicable, the very first line of the actual file content (immediately after the opening code fence) must be the filename marker:

@@FILENAME@@ path/to/your/file.ext
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

The path/to/your/file.ext must exactly match the path used in the START marker.

File Content: Insert the entire, unmodified content of the file after the optional @@FILENAME@@ marker (or immediately after the opening code fence if the @@FILENAME@@ marker is not used).

Closing Code Fence: Immediately before the END marker line, place a closing Markdown code fence on its own line:

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

End Marker: End each file's content with an end marker on its own line:

--- END OF FILE path/to/your/file.ext ---
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

The path/to/your/file.ext must exactly match the path used in the corresponding START OF FILE marker.

Example (Python File):

--- START OF FILE src/config_manager.py ---
```python
@@FILENAME@@ src/config_manager.py
import json
import os

CONFIG_FILE = 'config.json'

def load_config():
    # Function implementation...
    if os.path.exists(CONFIG_FILE):
        with open(CONFIG_FILE, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    return {}

# More file content...

def save_config(config):
    # Function implementation...
    with open(CONFIG_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(config, f, indent=4)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Text
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

--- END OF FILE src/config_manager.py ---

**Example (CSS File - without leading @@FILENAME@@):**

```text
--- START OF FILE extension/highlight.css ---
```css
/* Style for the initial highlight */
.ai-code-capture-highlight {
  background-color: yellow !important;
  outline: 2px solid orange !important;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease-out, outline 0.5s ease-out;
}

/* Style after highlight fades */
.ai-code-capture-highlight-fade {
  background-color: transparent !important;
  outline: none !important;
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

--- END OF FILE extension/highlight.css ---

**Key Formatting Points:**

*   Use the exact `--- START OF FILE path/to/file.ext ---` format.
*   Use the exact `--- END OF FILE path/to/file.ext ---` format.
*   Filenames in START and END markers must match exactly for each file.
*   Use Markdown code fences (` ```language` and ` ``` `) immediately surrounding the actual file content (and the optional `@@FILENAME@@` marker).
*   Include the `@@FILENAME@@ path/to/file.ext` line as the very first line inside the opening code fence *only if it's part of the intended file content*.
*   Ensure there is at least one blank line between the `--- END OF FILE ... ---` marker of one file and the `--- START OF FILE ... ---` marker of the next file.

Strict adherence to this format is essential for automated processing.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
