describe problems fixed in this chat session in form of verify that....

Okay, here is a summary of the problems fixed during this chat session, phrased as verification steps:

**Initial Setup & Server:**

1.  **Verify that** the `server.py` script starts without `SyntaxError` related to missing colons (`:`) after `try` statements within `except` blocks (specifically fixed in `check_shell_syntax`).
2.  **Verify that** the `server.py` script starts without `NameError: name 'sys' is not defined` (specifically fixed in `routes/status.py` by adding `import sys`).
3.  **Verify that** the server correctly loads configuration from `server_config.json` if it exists, and uses defaults otherwise.
4.  **Verify that** command-line arguments (`--port`, `--shell`, `--enable-python-run`) correctly override settings from the config file for the *running* server instance.
5.  **Verify that** the server's startup messages clearly display the *Effective RUNNING Settings* being used.

**Popup UI & Settings:**

6.  **Verify that** the popup correctly displays the initial server port number (specific to the current tab or the default) and the global activation state upon opening.
7.  **Verify that** the popup displays the server's Current Working Directory (CWD), relative Save Directory, relative Log Directory, and Git Repository status (Enabled/Disabled) after a successful connection test or initial load.
8.  **Verify that** the popup layout is more compact, labels/text are concise, and the 'Test' button is located on the same line as the Port input field.
9.  **Verify that** the popup displays controls (toggles) for 'Auto-Run Python' and 'Auto-Run Shell'.
10. **Verify that** the initial state of the auto-run toggles in the popup reflects the *currently running* state reported by the server.

**Configuration Management:**

11. **Verify that** changing the port number in the popup only affects the *current browser tab's* communication with the server and does not change the stored default port or other tabs' ports.
12. **Verify that** changing the 'Auto-Run Py' or 'Auto-Run Sh' toggles in the popup saves the configuration to `server_config.json`.
13. **Verify that** changing the 'Auto-Run Py' or 'Auto-Run Sh' toggles in the popup applies the setting to the *currently running* server process immediately (without requiring a server restart).
14. **Verify that** changing the auto-run toggles in the popup successfully communicates with the background script and triggers a request to the server's `/update_config` endpoint without causing a `current_app is not defined` error in the background script console.
15. **Verify that** the popup status message correctly indicates when a server restart is needed (only for port changes) versus when a setting (auto-run flags) is applied immediately.

**Core Functionality (Code Capture & Processing):**

16. **Verify that** code blocks marked with `@@FILENAME@@` at the beginning in AI Studio are detected by the content script.
17. **Verify that** detected code blocks receive the initial yellow highlight (`.aicapture-highlight`).
18. **Verify that** requests are sent from the extension to the server's `/submit_code` endpoint for detected code blocks.
19. **Verify that** the server queues concurrent `/submit_code` requests and processes them sequentially using the blocking lock, instead of returning a 429 'Server busy' error.
20. **Verify that** the server correctly determines the save target (Git vs. fallback) based on the `@@FILENAME@@` marker, repository status, and file tracking status.
21. **Verify that** HTML content generated by the AI is correctly saved to disk (either in Git or the fallback directory).
22. **Verify that** the server correctly skips syntax checks and execution attempts for non-Python/non-Shell files (like HTML).
23. **Verify that** after server processing, the highlight on the code block in AI Studio changes to green (`.aicapture-success`) or red (`.aicapture-error`) based on the server's response.
24. **Verify that** the final success/error highlight is eventually removed after a delay.
