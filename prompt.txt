**CRUCIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODE BLOCK FORMATTING:**

1.  **Show Full Content:** When you are asked to show the modified content of a file, ALWAYS provide the *complete* file content in the code block.
2.  **Mandatory Filename Marker:** You **MUST** include a filename marker at the very beginning of the code block.
3.  **Marker Format:** The marker format is *exactly*:
    `@@FILENAME@@ path/relative/to/project/root.ext`
    *(Replace `path/relative/to/project/root.ext` with the correct file path relative to the project root.)*
4.  **Strict First Line Placement:** The `@@FILENAME@@` marker **MUST** be on the **VERY FIRST LINE** of the code block.
5.  **No Prefix:** Do **NOT** put *anything* before the `@@FILENAME@@` marker on the first line (no comments like `//` or `#`, no code, nothing except optional leading whitespace which is ignored).
6.  **Code Starts on Line 2:** The actual code content of the file **MUST** begin on the second line.
7.  **(Optional) End Marker:** For clarity in our chat, you *may* add a separator line after the *entire* code block, like `--- END OF @@FILENAME@@ path/to/file.ext ---`.

**Why is this important?** An automated tool reads your code blocks. It *strictly* expects the `@@FILENAME@@` marker on the first line to identify the file and removes that line before saving. Any deviation will cause errors.
