ALWAYS include the full file content when showing or modifying files.

ALWAYS add in the very first line marker @@FILENAME@@ and path/to/modified/file.ext.

ALWAYS if showing fill file content for file type which supports comments (JSON doesn't support comments)
include filename at bottom after file has ended as comment.
